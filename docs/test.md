# Training FAQS

## What is the training about?
- It is about garnering all the traits required to be a UI developer in the Bay Area. But it is mostly about Javascript. A little bit of DOM, HTML5 and HTML5 APIs, CSS3, Restful Web Design, NodeJS, ReactJS and a few other topics too. 
The objective of the training is to make you an expert at working with Core JS, as the most important aspect of a UI interview is the ability to use the core concepts of Javascript to work towards a solution.
