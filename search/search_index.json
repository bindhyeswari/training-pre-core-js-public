It is about garnering all the traits required to be a UI developer in the Bay Area. But it is mostly about Javascript. A little bit of DOM, HTML5 and HTML5 APIs, CSS3, Restful Web Design, NodeJS, ReactJS and a few other topics too. The objective of the training is to make you an expert at working with Core JS, as the most important aspect of a UI interview is the ability to use the core concepts of Javascript to work towards a solution. Trainer background? Most of our trainers come in from industry stalwarts like Netflix. They are passionate about learning upcoming tech and passing on their knowledge to you. Type of training? The training is mostly classroom based. We believe interaction is critical in learning. Even when we ask you to study up on reference material, we would urge you to do that, with us, in person, to quash any doubts or misunderstandings that you might have. Time required from trainees? We need at least 8-10 hours of effort per day. How does the placement tie in with the training? Core interview question preparation is inbuilt into the training course. Soft skills and resume preparation will be covered by us after you are done with the technical training. Interview prep and placement process? Placement option will be available to all candidates who have consistently performed well on our unit tests and are dedicated to their career. Time period? 6-8wk for Track 1 10-12wk for Track 2 and Track 3(?) What are Tracks? We understand when you have an issue with time commitments. Hence we have two options: Track 1 ($3k training) (6-8wk) (Offset with $0 down for good candidates) You can provide full day commitment to the course You will be required to study (2-3 hours), work on projects (3-4 hours), research (1 hour) and give tests(1-2 hours) daily You are dedicated to getting a job within the 2 months of starting to train with us. Track 2 ($6k training) (10-12wk) (Mandatory $3k down) You have other time commitments and can only give 6 hours a day. You will study and work on projects on alternate days. After the training, you will take a test and submit your projects so that we can decide on placements. How much time do we have to spend in the classroom Classroom sessions are 6-8 hrs a week (in-person) In-classroom help (on theory and projects) time is ~12 hours (in-classroom) help and discussions.","title":"Training FAQS"},{"location":"test/#training-faqs","text":"","title":"Training FAQS"},{"location":"test/#what-is-the-training-about","text":"It is about garnering all the traits required to be a UI developer in the Bay Area.
